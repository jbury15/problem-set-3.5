    <h1>
      <p>Next the probably the most important event in the history of professional football in the USA, 
    the merge of the NFL and AFL. Prior to the merge of the two leagues, the NFL thought that it was the 
    bigger league, and that the AFL was would only get second-rate players from the NFL, or washed up NFL 
    players. This changed when the New York Jets drafted Joe Namath from Alabama, and the entire dynamics of 
    both leagues changed. Rather than the NFL being the dominant league, both leagues began to compete for fans, 
    players, and coaches. It came to a point that both leagues were too big to coexist, and the NFL AFL merger 
    occurred. In this, all of the original eight AFL teams became a part of the NFL, and they were put into their 
    own conference. The two conferences became the NFC(National Football Conference) and the AFL(American Football Conference).</p>
